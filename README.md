## Howdy Folks 👋🏼
My name is Jonas and I'm a Full-Stack Developer. I'm a graduate of <a href="https://www.okcoders.com/">OK Coders</a> 2022 cohort and continue to be involved in the community by acting as a mentor for incoming students. I recently became an active member of the <a href="https://www.techlahoma.org/">Techlahoma</a> Foundation where you can catch me at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/OKCWebDevs/">OKC WebDevs</a> & <a href="https://www.meetup.com/okccoffeeandcode/">OKC Coffee & Code</a> events amongst many others! I'm currently working on Harvard University's <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript">CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</a> course. Stay tuned as I'll be adding more projects onto my profile soon!
